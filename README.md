# Summary
This is a little write up about my greatest fear **failure**.

# Failure
My **greatest fear** is about as generic as it comes. I'm afraid of failure. I know this soudns pretty cliche, but its true **failure** can be a pretty scay thing.
**Failure** is the inability to reach ones goal despite the effort one puits forth. This is something that scares me because I feel that I lose my opportunity to acheive what I set out to do. I know just as much as everyone else that **failure** does't mean loss, but that is how it has felt to me through most of my life. I play basketball as my main sport and trust me when I say you lose a lot when playing sports, and in sports a **failure** results in a loss where there are no second chances. This is different from most other things in life like computer science for example. In computer science you have to **fail** a lot in order to succeed, and it is unbeleivably aggrivating. That is one of the main reasosn why I took this course in the first. In order to overcoem a **fear** you have to be faced with it countless times and continue to push through each **failure**.
